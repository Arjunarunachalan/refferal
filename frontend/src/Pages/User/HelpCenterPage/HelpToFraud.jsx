                                                    protection or an online payment system. These emails will typically request that you send
                                                    money via this site or provide personal information. DealNBuy and most other companies will
                                                    never send out such emails. If you send money via these sites you are likely sending money

                                                    Often the cheque will bounce and you will have lost all money you sent to the other party.

                                                <p>A seller claims that there are brokerage fees, import duties, or other such fees required to
                                                    get an item into India. Do not pay such fees, as you will most often never get the product and

                                                <p>A buyer or seller suggests using an escrow service to complete the transaction. Often these

                                                    take your money and never send you the product.

                                                    thousand rupees an hour by stuffing envelopes. But to make that money, you need to sell the
